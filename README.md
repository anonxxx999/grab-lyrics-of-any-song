# grab-lyrics-of-any-song
It is a simple web scraping python script to get/scrape/grab any lyrics of any song.
It prints the lyrics of the song in the terminal/cmd, and it creates automatically folder names "Lyrics" , inside this folder it creates a folder called "the name of the singer" and inside it , it create a text file with the name of the song and the text file contains the lyrics of the song.
